Terms and Conditions Summary for @binlistrobot
Last Updated: May 13, 2025

By using the @binlistrobot Telegram Bot (the "Bot"), you agree to these summarized Terms and Conditions. For full details, please refer to the complete Terms and Conditions document [Optional: Add link here if you create a separate, more detailed T&C file, e.g., (see TERMS.md)].

Service Overview:

The Bot provides Bank Identification Number (BIN) lookup services using the external API lookup.binlist.net.
It displays information such as bank, scheme, brand, type, and country associated with a BIN.
Results include attribution to the user requesting the lookup, the Bot's username (@binlistrobot), and a contact link to the Bot's Administrator.
The designated Bot Administrator (Telegram User ID: 2062370002) can broadcast messages to users who have interacted with the Bot.
Acceptance of Terms:

Your use of the Bot (e.g., sending /start, /bin) constitutes your acceptance of these terms.
Data Privacy & Storage:

User IDs: The Bot stores your Telegram chat_id in a local JSON file (bot_user_ids.json) when you interact with it. This is necessary for the Bot to reply to your commands and for the Administrator to send broadcast messages.
BIN Queries: BINs you query are sent to lookup.binlist.net. The Bot itself does not store these queried BINs long-term.
No Other Personal Data: The Bot does not intentionally collect or store other personal data beyond what is essential for its operation and provided by Telegram (like your first name and username for attribution).
Data Security: While reasonable efforts are made, 100% security of stored chat_ids cannot be guaranteed.
User Responsibilities:

You agree to use the Bot lawfully and not to misuse, spam, or attempt to exploit it.
Information from the BIN lookup is for informational purposes and should be used responsibly.
Administrator & Broadcasts:

The Bot Administrator (User ID: 2062370002) may send broadcast messages to all registered users.
By using the Bot, you acknowledge you may receive such broadcasts. You can block the Bot to stop receiving messages.
Third-Party API (lookup.binlist.net):

The Bot relies on lookup.binlist.net for BIN data. We are not responsible for the accuracy, availability, or content from this third-party service.
Disclaimers:

The Bot is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" without warranties of any kind regarding its operation, accuracy of information, or uptime.
Limitation of Liability:

The Bot owner/developer shall not be liable for any damages arising from your use or inability to use the Bot.
Changes to Terms:

These terms may be updated. Continued use of the Bot after changes implies acceptance. Major changes will be communicated if feasible (e.g., via broadcast).
Contact:

For issues or questions, you can try to contact the Bot Administrator, for example, through the link provided in BIN lookup results which directs to tg://user?id=2062370002.
