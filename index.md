Our privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how the BIN Lookup Bot collects, uses, and protects the information you provide when using our service.

1. Information We Collect
The Bot collects only the following information when you use it:

BIN (Bank Identification Number): A 6- to 8-digit number input by the user for lookup purposes.

We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) such as full credit card numbers, names, addresses, or contact details.

2. How We Use the Information
We use the BIN provided by you solely to:

Look up and display card issuer information such as country, vendor, card type, level, and issuing bank.

This information is processed in real-time and not stored on our servers or shared with third parties.

3. Data Storage
We do not store, log, or retain any BINs or lookup results. All lookups are temporary and session-based.

4. Third-Party Services
If the Bot uses external BIN databases or APIs, those services may have their own privacy policies. We recommend reviewing them separately if applicable.

5. Security
We implement standard security measures to ensure that any data transmitted during the lookup process is protected. However, as with any digital service, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

6. Children's Privacy
This service is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect data from children.

7. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted with an updated effective date.
